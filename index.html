    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p><em>"A total body workout that never gets boring. I'm stronger and leaner than ever." ‚Äì Male Participant</em></p>
    <p><em>"One of the best instructors I've trained with. Her energy is contagious!" ‚Äì Regular Attendee</em></p>
    <p><em>"Hello Monisha, I want to thank you for being a very amazing aerobics teacher. I never thought I would get so involved and like aerobics so much, all credits to you! I joined the classes thinking that I will skip zumba and do only the other sessions since I was extremely shy to dance and never moved my body except for Ganpati dance (rare). But today zumba sessions are one of my favourites and I really started to like dancing. Again all credits to you! Your way of teaching is really great and the way you make students push their limits is really fun and I enjoyed it a lot. The sessions were one of the best parts of the day and I'll miss you all a lot! I hope the club continues forever and keeps growing! Thank you so... much for your training. Take care!" ‚Äì Former Student</em></p>
    <p><em>"Hi Monisha, I won't be able to join aerobics anymore. I shifted outside the campus and soon, less than 2 months, I will go for postdoc. Thank you for everything, I really enjoyed my time in aerobics, a lot. I will always find an alternative class to join and continue exercising. It won't be cool and wonderful like your class, of course üòé. Your class really changed my life in the last two years. Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è and wishing you all the best‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è" ‚Äì Long-term Participant</em></p>
